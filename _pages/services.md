## Core Services

I help athletes, coaches, and organizations make clear training and performance decisions using testing, monitoring, and structured strength & conditioning support.

### Performance Testing & Monitoring

Clear, repeatable tests that show how prepared an athlete is and how their performance is changing over time.

**Who this helps**
- **For Coaches:** Shows who is ready to train hard, who needs adjustments, and where strengths and weaknesses are.
- **For Athletes:** Shows what is improving, what needs work, and gives simple targets to guide training.
- **For Organizations:** Ensures all athletes are tested the same way, creates clean records, and supports long-term planning.

**What you get**
- A standardized testing session with clear indicators of readiness and performance.
- A concise report showing current status, recent changes, and priority focus areas.
- Trend tracking across weeks or months to guide training adjustments.
- Results delivered in simple tables and visuals that can be interpreted immediately by coaches and athletes.

### Sport Science Projects & Analytics

Turning performance data into clear answers that support better coaching and planning. These projects are **designed to answer** specific performance or planning questions, **not to generate more data.**

**Who this helps**
- **For Coaches:** Turns testing and game data into simple takeaways you can act on, without needing to “do the stats” yourself.
- **For Athletes:** Shows how changes in training, technique, or recovery are affecting performance over time.
- **For Organizations:** Supports bigger questions such as talent ID, return-to-play decisions, and long-term planning.

**What you get**
- A clearly defined performance or planning question the project is built around.
- A short written summary of findings, implications, and recommendations.
- Simple visuals or tools that remain usable after the project ends.
- Optional setup of dashboards or tracking systems aligned to your environment.

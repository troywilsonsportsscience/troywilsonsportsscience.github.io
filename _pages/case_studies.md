## Applied Performance Work

These examples show how testing, monitoring, and analysis were used to improve **training and performance decisions** in real-world environments.

The focus is on decision quality, repeatability, and practical use — not data volume.

### Large-Group Hockey Testing Protocol Optimization

**Context**  
Multi-team hockey environment supporting 20+ teams and over 200 athletes.

**Problem**  
High athlete volume led to long testing days, inconsistent protocols, and large datasets that were difficult for coaches to interpret. Early testing batteries produced more data than actionable decisions.

**Action**  
The testing system was rebuilt multiple times into a condensed, standardized battery focused on a small number of high-value metrics. Automated summaries were created to flag readiness and priority focus areas immediately after testing, while maintaining consistency across teams.

**Outcome**  
Testing time was reduced while decision quality improved. Coaches received clear, actionable outputs instead of large spreadsheets, enabling immediate training adjustments and consistent application across teams and seasons.

### Individual Track Athlete Assessment (Decision Example)

**Context**  
An individual track and field athlete during a focused training phase.

**Problem**  
Performance testing produced mixed results, making it unclear which physical qualities should be prioritized in training.

**Action**  
A targeted assessment was used to identify key limiting factors rather than expanding the test battery. Results were interpreted to determine the most impactful change in training focus.

**Outcome**  
Training priorities were adjusted to address the identified limiting qualities, providing clearer direction and a more efficient use of training time.

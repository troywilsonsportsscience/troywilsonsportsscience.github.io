## About Me

I work across applied sport science, strength and conditioning, and data analytics, helping athletes, coaches, and organizations make better decisions. My background spans athlete testing, performance monitoring, dashboard development, and building analytical tools that solve real performance problems.

My work integrates:

- Sport science testing and interpretation  
- Strength & conditioning planning and support  
- Data analysis, KPI development, and dashboards  
- Tools for coaches and high-performance systems  

This site organizes my projects, case studies, services, and resources in one place.
